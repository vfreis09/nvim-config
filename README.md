My kickstarter.nvim config

the vim-be-good plugin shows an error when you type the :VimBeGood command but it works when you try to use 

i made an prettierd (installed with Mason) autocmd command to format on save using :w

other than this two things (prettierd setup and vim-be-good) i only changed the default colorscheme to catppuccin

other than that is the default kickstart.nvim config
